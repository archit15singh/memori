# Letter to Dev

Hey there,

So, you’re interested in building `memori`. Awesome. I’m going to walk you through exactly how it works, from the ground up. Forget everything you think you know about AI agents being black boxes. We’re going to build something transparent, debuggable, and truly intelligent.

The big idea behind `memori` is simple: AI agents today have a terrible memory. They can perform tasks, but they can't step back and think about *why* they know what they know. They can't spot when their own information is outdated or wrong. They can act, but they can’t debug their own reasoning.

We're going to fix that by building a **Reflective Journaling Bot**. Think of it as a simple chat application, but with a twist: every single interaction updates a living, editable memory for the bot. We're going to build this using a powerful API that treats an agent's memory like a database we can fully control.

Here’s the blueprint.

### Step 1: Building the Memory Box (CRUD Operations)

First things first, our agent needs a memory it can actually control. We need the basic ability to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete memories. Think of it like a simple contacts app, but for an AI's knowledge. The API gives us the endpoints to do this directly.

**To Create Memories (Adding new knowledge):**

1.  **Create the Agent:** First, you need the agent itself—its "brain," so to speak. You'll make a `POST` request to `/api-reference/agents/create`. This gives you a fresh agent with its own empty memory.
2.  **Add a Memory:** Now, let's give it a piece of information. You can't just "tell" it; you have to log the memory formally. You do this by creating a "source" document. Package the memory (e.g., "My user's name is Alex") into a simple text file and upload it using `POST /api-reference/sources/create`, linking it to your new agent's ID.

**To Read Memories (Asking the agent what it knows):**

1.  **Peek at its "Working Memory":** Want to know what the agent is thinking about *right now*? Use `GET /api-reference/agents/context/retrieve`. This shows you the information currently loaded in its active context, like the RAM on your computer.
2.  **Search its "Long-Term Memory":** To see everything it has stored away, you can either retrieve the raw source documents with `GET /api-reference/sources/retrieve` or, more powerfully, perform a search just like the agent would using `POST /api-reference/agents/search`. This lets you query its entire knowledge base on a topic.

**To Update or Delete Memories (Correcting the agent):**

1.  **Correct a Memory:** The best way to "update" a memory is to remove the old one and add the corrected version. This keeps the memory log clean. Use `DELETE /api-reference/sources/delete` to remove the outdated source, and then use the `POST /api-reference/sources/create` flow to add the new, correct information.
2.  **Modify the Agent's Core Beliefs:** For fundamental changes to the agent's persona (like its name or primary goal), you can directly use `PATCH /api-reference/agents/modify`.

### Step 2: The Timeline - A `git log` for Reasoning

This is where it gets really cool. We don't just want to manage memories; we want a historical record of how the agent's understanding changes over time. My favorite analogy for this is `git log` for reasoning. Every time the agent learns, forgets, or reasons, it's a "commit" in its memory timeline.

The API gives us two sets of endpoints for this:

* **The Commit History (`runs`):** A "run" is a complete task or conversation. By calling `GET /api-reference/runs/list`, you get a high-level history of everything the agent has done.
* **The Line-by-Line Diff (`steps`):** This is the magic. For any given run, you can call `GET /api-reference/steps/list` to see *every single thought* the agent had along the way: every memory it searched for, every conclusion it reached, every tool it used. If you want to zoom in on one specific thought, use `GET /api-reference/steps/retrieve` with a step ID. This is how we make the agent's reasoning process completely transparent and debuggable.

### Step 3: The Spark - Teaching It to Think About Its Thinking (Reflection)

This is the core of `memori`. We’ll use the tools we have to build a process for reflection and knowledge gap detection. This isn't a single API call; it's an intelligent loop you orchestrate *with* the API.

Here’s the logic you'll build:

1.  **Trigger a "Reflection Run":** Start a new conversation with the agent. But instead of asking a normal question, give it a meta-instruction: `"Review our recent conversation logs. Cross-reference them with your core objectives. Identify any contradictions, outdated facts, or missing information that you need to do your job better."`
2.  **Self-Inspection (The Agent Uses the "Read" APIs):** The agent will now start a `run` where it uses its own tools to inspect its memory. You'll see `steps` appear in the timeline where it's calling endpoints like `/api/agents/context/retrieve` to check its goals and `/api/agents/search` to query its long-term memory about the conversation.
3.  **Identify the Gaps:** The agent's LLM brain will analyze the results of its self-inspection. For example, it might notice: "The user mentioned Project X, but I have no stored memories about what Project X's deadline is. This is a knowledge gap."
4.  **Take Corrective Action (The Agent Uses the "CRUD" APIs):** Once it finds a gap, it can act:
    * It can proactively ask you a question: "I noticed we spoke about Project X, but I don't have its deadline logged. Could you tell me what it is?"
    * Or, if it found an outdated memory, it could automatically perform the `DELETE` and `CREATE` flow to correct its own knowledge base.

That’s the blueprint. By combining these three steps, you move from a simple chatbot to a self-aware system that actively manages and debugs its own memory. You’re not just building an app; you’re building a foundational piece of open-source infrastructure for creating truly intelligent and transparent AI.

Let's get building.
