# Contributing to memori

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project aims to be a **small, composable** memory layer with a clean API and a runnable demo.

## Getting started
1. Fork the repo & clone locally.
2. `docker compose up -d` to start Postgres (and Redis/Valkey).
3. Create a feature branch.
4. Add tests for your change.
5. Open a PR with a clear description.

## Project priorities (keep PRs aligned)
- Minimal public API (CRUD, reflect, gap detection)
- Small, readable code
- First working demo over fancy features
- Tests & docs before integrations

## Good first issues
We maintain `good first issue` labels for newcomers. Check the issue tracker.

## Code of Conduct
Be kind, be helpful. We follow the FOSS United ethos and the CNCF CoC spirit.
