### **Reflective Journaling Bot - Building Memory as Open Infrastructure**

Open-source agents today can call APIs, search vectors, and query databases. But none of them *reflect* on what’s missing, outdated, or wrong in their memory. They can act, but they can’t debug their own reasoning.

I built a Reflective Journaling Bot - a minimal OSS tool where every chat updates an editable memory timeline (CRUD: create, read, update, delete). Developers can pause, inspect, or overwrite memories, just like you’d debug a state in a program. It’s a living demo of what ‘memory as OSS infra’ can look like.”

This isn’t just about agents or AI. Reflection is a general OSS problem: how do we design systems that surface their own blind spots? Journaling as an open interface creates a model for debugging, reproducibility, and collective understanding. Think of it as `git log` for reasoning — transparent, inspectable, and hackable by the community.
