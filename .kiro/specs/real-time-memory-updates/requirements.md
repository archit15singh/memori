# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables real-time updates to the memories display in the UI when memories are created, updated, or deleted during chat interactions. Currently, users must manually refresh the page to see memory changes, which creates a poor user experience and breaks the flow of conversation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user chatting with the system, I want to see memory updates immediately in the UI, so that I can understand how my conversation is being processed and stored without interrupting my chat flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new memory is created during chat THEN the UI SHALL display the new memory immediately without page refresh
2. WHEN an existing memory is updated during chat THEN the UI SHALL show the updated memory content immediately
3. WHEN a memory is deleted during chat THEN the UI SHALL remove the memory from display immediately
4. WHEN memory operations occur THEN the UI SHALL maintain the current chat context and scroll position

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the memory updates to be visually clear, so that I can easily notice when memories change during our conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a memory is newly created THEN the UI SHALL highlight or animate the new memory entry
2. WHEN a memory is updated THEN the UI SHALL indicate which memory was modified with visual feedback
3. WHEN a memory is deleted THEN the UI SHALL provide smooth removal animation
4. IF multiple memory operations occur simultaneously THEN the UI SHALL handle all updates without visual conflicts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the real-time updates to be reliable, so that I can trust the memory display reflects the actual system state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend processes memory operations THEN the frontend SHALL receive notifications within 1 second
2. IF a memory operation fails THEN the UI SHALL not show the change and SHALL display an error indicator
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the UI SHALL indicate the real-time sync status
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the UI SHALL automatically sync any missed memory updates
