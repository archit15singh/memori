# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature makes chat responses memory-aware by including all stored memories as context in the LLM system prompt. The bot will naturally reference its memories when responding.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory Context Loading

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to have access to all its stored memories when responding, so that conversations feel consistent and personalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot generates a response THEN the system SHALL load all memories from the database
2. WHEN memories are loaded THEN the system SHALL organize them by category (identity, principles, focus, signals)

### Requirement 2: Memory-Enhanced System Prompt

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to naturally reference its memories in responses, so that it feels like talking to someone who remembers our previous conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL include all memories in the LLM system prompt
2. WHEN memories are included THEN the system SHALL format them clearly by category
