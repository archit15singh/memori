# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature makes chat responses memory-aware by including all stored memories as context in the LLM system prompt. The bot will naturally reference its memories when responding, creating personalized and consistent conversations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory Context Loading

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to have access to all its stored memories when responding, so that conversations feel consistent and personalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot generates a response THEN the system SHALL load all memories from the database
2. WHEN memories are loaded THEN the system SHALL organize them by category (identity, principles, focus, signals)
3. WHEN memory loading fails THEN the system SHALL continue with normal chat functionality
4. WHEN no memories exist THEN the system SHALL respond normally without memory context

### Requirement 2: Memory-Enhanced System Prompt

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to naturally reference its memories in responses, so that it feels like talking to someone who remembers our previous conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL include all memories in the LLM system prompt
2. WHEN memories are included THEN the system SHALL format them clearly by category
3. WHEN the prompt is built THEN the system SHALL stay within LLM token limits
4. WHEN memories are referenced THEN the system SHALL integrate them naturally into responses

### Requirement 3: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want memory-informed responses to be fast and reliable, so that chat performance doesn't degrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading memories THEN the system SHALL complete within 100ms
2. WHEN memory operations fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to normal chat
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL maintain current chat response times
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging without blocking chat
