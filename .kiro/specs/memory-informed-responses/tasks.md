# Implementation Plan

## Core Implementation Tasks

- [ ] 1. Create memory loading function for chat
  - Create `load_all_memories_for_chat()` function that wraps existing `get_all_memories()`
  - Add error handling and logging for memory loading failures
  - Add simple caching to avoid repeated database queries within short timeframes
  - Test function with various database states (empty, populated, error conditions)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 2. Create memory context formatter
  - Implement `format_memories_for_prompt(memories)` function to convert memory objects to readable text
  - Format memories by category with clear headers and structure
  - Keep formatting concise to minimize token usage
  - Test formatting with various memory configurations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Build enhanced system prompt
  - Create memory-aware system prompt template with placeholders for memory context
  - Implement `build_memory_aware_prompt(memory_context, user_message)` function
  - Ensure prompt stays within reasonable token limits
  - Test prompt building with different memory sets
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 4. Modify existing chat function
  - Update `get_ai_response()` function to load memories before generating response
  - Integrate memory context into OpenAI API call
  - Add fallback logic to use original chat function if memory loading fails
  - Maintain existing function signature and behavior for compatibility
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Add error handling and fallback
  - Create `get_ai_response_fallback()` function with original chat logic
  - Add comprehensive error handling for memory loading and prompt building
  - Ensure chat functionality continues even when memory system fails
  - Add logging for debugging memory-related issues
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.2, 3.4_

## Testing and Validation Tasks

- [ ] 6. Test memory-informed responses
  - Test chat responses with various memory configurations
  - Verify that bot naturally references relevant memories in responses
  - Test conversations about identity, principles, focus, and signals topics
  - Validate that memory references feel natural and not forced
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [ ] 7. Test performance and reliability
  - Measure memory loading time and ensure it stays under 100ms
  - Test chat response times with memory context vs without
  - Verify fallback behavior when memory loading fails
  - Test with large memory sets to validate token limit handling
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Test error scenarios
  - Test behavior when database is unavailable
  - Test with corrupted or invalid memory data
  - Verify graceful degradation in all error conditions
  - Test recovery after temporary failures
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.2, 3.4_

## Success Criteria

**Implementation Complete When:**
- Bot includes all stored memories in response context
- Responses naturally reference relevant memories without being forced
- Chat functionality works with or without memory context
- Performance remains acceptable with memory loading
- Error handling provides graceful fallback behavior

**Quality Validation:**
- Memory references feel natural and conversational
- Bot demonstrates awareness of its stored identity, principles, focus, and signals
- System maintains reliability even with memory system failures
- Response times stay within acceptable limits
