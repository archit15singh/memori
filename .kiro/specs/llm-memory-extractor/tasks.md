# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create memory extraction function
  - Implement `extract_memories()` function that calls OpenAI API with conversation context
  - Create system prompt for memory extraction with bucket definitions and output format
  - Handle existing memory keys to avoid duplicates and enable updates
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [x] 2. Create memory action processor
  - Implement `apply_memory_actions()` function to process extracted memory actions
  - Handle "create" actions by inserting new memories with generated UUIDs
  - Handle "update" actions by finding existing memory IDs and updating values
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Integrate memory extraction into chat endpoint
  - Modify `/chat` endpoint to call memory extraction after generating AI response
  - Load existing memory keys by bucket before extraction
  - Call memory extraction asynchronously to avoid blocking chat response
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [x] 4. Add error handling and logging
  - Wrap memory extraction in try-catch to prevent chat failures
  - Add logging for successful memory extractions and errors
  - Handle invalid JSON responses from LLM gracefully
  - _Requirements: 1.3_

- [x] 5. Test memory extraction functionality
  - Create test conversations that should generate memories in each bucket
  - Verify memories are correctly stored in database with proper bucket classification
  - Test memory updates when keys already exist
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_
