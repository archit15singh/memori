# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds automatic memory extraction to the existing chat system. After each chat response, the system will analyze the conversation and extract key-value memories into the existing 4-bucket system (identity, principles, focus, signals).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to automatically learn about me from our conversations, so that it becomes more personalized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat conversation completes THEN the system SHALL extract memories from the user message and assistant response
2. WHEN memories are extracted THEN the system SHALL store them as key-value pairs in the existing database
3. WHEN extraction fails THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without affecting chat

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want extracted memories to be organized properly, so that they integrate with the existing memory system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting memories THEN the system SHALL classify them into identity, principles, focus, or signals buckets
2. WHEN a memory key already exists THEN the system SHALL update the existing value
3. WHEN extracting memories THEN the system SHALL limit to maximum 3 memories per conversation
