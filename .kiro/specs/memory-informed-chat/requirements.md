# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature makes the chat system memory-aware by including all stored memories in chat responses and automatically extracting new memories from conversations. The bot will use its complete memory store as context when responding and identify new insights to add to its memory.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory-Informed Responses

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to use its stored memories when responding to my messages, so that conversations feel personalized and consistent with what it knows about itself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot generates a response THEN the system SHALL include all stored memories as context in the LLM prompt
2. WHEN the bot responds THEN the system SHALL reference relevant memories naturally in its response
3. WHEN the bot has no memories THEN the system SHALL respond normally without memory context
4. WHEN memory loading fails THEN the system SHALL continue with normal chat functionality

### Requirement 2: Automatic Memory Extraction

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to automatically identify new insights from our conversations, so that its memory grows naturally over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I share information in a conversation THEN the system SHALL analyze the conversation for new memory insights
2. WHEN new insights are found THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate memory category (identity, principles, focus, signals)
3. WHEN extracting memories THEN the system SHALL create clear key-value pairs
4. WHEN memory extraction is uncertain THEN the system SHALL not create poor quality memories
5. WHEN new memories are extracted THEN the system SHALL automatically store them in the database
6. WHEN memories are created THEN the system SHALL update the frontend memory display

### Requirement 3: Memory Management Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically manage memory updates, so that the memory store stays current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new insight matches an existing memory key THEN the system SHALL update the existing memory value
2. WHEN a new insight is completely new THEN the system SHALL create a new memory entry
3. WHEN memories are updated THEN the system SHALL use the existing memory ID to maintain consistency
4. WHEN memory operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors but continue normal chat operation
5. WHEN memories are modified THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in the frontend
