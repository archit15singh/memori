# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a FastAPI backend service with a basic chat endpoint that accepts input and returns output. The backend will provide a simple REST API interface for chat functionality, serving as the foundation for a chat application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a FastAPI backend server, so that I can provide REST API endpoints for my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server is started THEN the system SHALL run a FastAPI application on a specified port
2. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL be accessible via HTTP requests
3. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL log startup information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want a /chat endpoint, so that I can send messages and receive responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /chat THEN the system SHALL accept JSON input with a message field
2. WHEN valid input is received THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response with an output field
3. WHEN invalid input is received THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with status codes
4. WHEN the endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL process the input and generate a meaningful response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling, so that the API provides clear feedback for different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid JSON is sent THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request status
2. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return a 422 Unprocessable Entity status with field validation errors
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return a 500 Internal Server Error status
4. WHEN successful requests are made THEN the system SHALL return a 200 OK status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to be easily runnable, so that I can quickly start development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL have all required packages available
2. WHEN the run command is executed THEN the system SHALL start the server with hot reload for development
3. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL provide automatic API documentation via FastAPI's built-in docs
