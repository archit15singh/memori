## Introduction

Add a simple toggle control to enable/disable memory functionality in the chat application. Users can turn memory extraction and usage on or off.

2. WHEN memory is ON THEN the system SHALL extract memories and use them in responses
3. WHEN memory is OFF THEN the system SHALL NOT extract memories and SHALL NOT use them in responses
4. WHEN the toggle state changes THEN the system SHALL apply the setting immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback about the memory state, so that I know if memory is active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory is OFF THEN the memory sections SHALL show a dimmed/disabled appearance
2. WHEN memory is OFF THEN the system SHALL display "Memory disabled" text

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the toggle state to persist, so that my preference is remembered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes the toggle THEN the system SHALL save the preference locally
2. WHEN the user returns to the app THEN the system SHALL restore the saved toggle state
3. WHEN no preference exists THEN the system SHALL default to memory enabled
