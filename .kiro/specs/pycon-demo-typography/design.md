# Design Document

## Overview

This design implements PyCon demo typography improvements by updating the existing CSS with larger font sizes optimized for projector visibility. The approach focuses on direct CSS modifications to key typography classes without requiring React component changes or complex state management.

## Architecture

The solution uses a simple CSS-based approach that modifies existing font-size declarations in the current App.css file. This maintains the existing component structure while delivering the required typography improvements.

### Current Typography Analysis
- Section headers: Currently 20px (`font-size: 20px`)
- Section titles: Currently 20px (`font-size: 20px`) 
- Section subtitles: Currently 12px (`font-size: 12px`)
- Memory keys: Currently 14px (`font-size: 14px`)
- Memory text: Currently 13px (`font-size: 13px`)
- Chat messages: Currently default (inherited from body)
- Chat input: Currently 14px (`font-size: 14px`)

## Components and Interfaces

### CSS Class Modifications

The design targets these specific CSS selectors for font-size updates:

1. **Section Headers**
   - `.section-title` - Update from 20px to 22px
   
2. **Memory Cards**
   - `.memory-key` - Update from 14px to 18px
   - `.memory-text` - Update from 13px to 16px
   
3. **Chat Interface**
   - `.message-text` - Add explicit 18px font-size
   - `.chat-input` - Update from 14px to 18px

4. **Line Height**
   - Add `line-height: 1.5` to all modified text elements

## Data Models

No data model changes required. This is a pure CSS styling update.

## Error Handling

No error handling required as this involves only CSS modifications. The changes are non-breaking and will gracefully degrade if CSS fails to load.

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. Verify font sizes visually match specifications
2. Test that all text remains readable and properly styled
3. Confirm no layout breaking or text overflow issues
4. Validate that existing functionality remains intact

### Visual Regression Testing
1. Compare before/after screenshots of key interface sections
2. Verify typography hierarchy is maintained
3. Ensure color contrast ratios remain acceptable

The implementation requires no JavaScript changes, making it low-risk and easily reversible if needed.
