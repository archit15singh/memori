# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements essential typography improvements for PyCon demo presentations, focusing on the 80/20 principle - the minimal changes that deliver maximum impact for projector legibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a presenter giving a PyCon demo, I want key text elements to be larger and more legible on projectors, so that my audience can clearly read the interface from the back of the room.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying section headers (Identity, Principles, etc.) THEN the system SHALL use 22px font size with semibold weight
2. WHEN displaying memory card keys THEN the system SHALL use 18px font size with medium weight  
3. WHEN displaying memory card values THEN the system SHALL use 16px font size
4. WHEN displaying chat messages THEN the system SHALL use 18px font size
5. WHEN displaying chat input THEN the system SHALL use 18px font size

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a presenter, I want consistent line-height that prevents cramped text appearance on projectors, so that all text remains readable at distance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying any text THEN the system SHALL use line-height of 1.5 for optimal readability
2. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain existing Inter font family
3. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL preserve existing color scheme and contrast ratios
