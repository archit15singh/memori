# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces the frontend's mock memory data with real backend API integration. Focus is on core functionality: loading, editing, and deleting memories through the UI.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my memories to work with a real backend, so that the memory system functions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the app THEN the system SHALL fetch memories from the backend
2. WHEN I edit a memory THEN the system SHALL update it on the backend
3. WHEN I delete a memory THEN the system SHALL remove it from the backend
