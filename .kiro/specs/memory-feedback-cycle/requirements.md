# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete memory feedback cycle for the chat system where conversations drive memory updates, and memories shape future conversations. The system creates a self-sustaining brain loop: user input triggers memory retrieval for context, generates responses using that memory, extracts new insights from the conversation, and updates the memory store to reflect the new reality. This creates a continuously evolving, personalized chat experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory-Contextualized Chat Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want every chat response to be informed by the bot's complete memory, so that conversations feel consistent and personalized based on what the bot knows about itself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL retrieve all memories from the KV store across all buckets (identity, principles, focus, signals)
2. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL include all retrieved memories as context in the system/developer prompt
3. WHEN memories are included THEN the system SHALL format them clearly by category for the LLM
4. WHEN no memories exist THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal chat functionality
5. WHEN memory retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with chat without memory context

### Requirement 2: Automatic Memory Extraction Pipeline

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to automatically learn from our conversations, so that its memory grows and evolves naturally without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat response is generated THEN the system SHALL run the Memory Extractor with the user input, assistant response, and current memory keys by bucket
2. WHEN the Memory Extractor runs THEN the system SHALL use deterministic settings (temperature 0, capped tool calls) to prevent hallucinated memories
3. WHEN analyzing conversations THEN the system SHALL identify insights that warrant memory operations (create, update, delete)
4. WHEN insights are identified THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate memory category (identity, principles, focus, signals)
5. WHEN extraction is uncertain THEN the system SHALL not create poor quality or speculative memories

### Requirement 3: Memory Tool Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want memory updates to happen automatically and immediately, so that the bot's knowledge stays current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Memory Extractor identifies new insights THEN the system SHALL emit appropriate tool calls (memory_write, memory_update, memory_delete)
2. WHEN tool calls are emitted THEN the system SHALL execute them immediately to update the database
3. WHEN creating new memories THEN the system SHALL use memory_write with category, key, and value parameters
4. WHEN updating existing memories THEN the system SHALL use memory_update with category, key, and new value parameters
5. WHEN removing outdated memories THEN the system SHALL use memory_delete with category and key parameters
6. WHEN tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL log errors but continue normal chat operation

### Requirement 4: Memory State Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the memory system to maintain consistency, so that the next conversation turn reflects the most current memory state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory operations complete THEN the system SHALL ensure the database reflects the updated state
2. WHEN the next chat turn begins THEN the system SHALL retrieve the freshest memory state
3. WHEN memories are updated THEN the system SHALL use existing memory IDs to maintain consistency
4. WHEN duplicate insights are detected THEN the system SHALL update existing memories rather than create duplicates
5. WHEN memory conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent information

### Requirement 5: Feedback Loop Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the memory feedback cycle to operate seamlessly, so that each conversation naturally builds on previous interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation turn completes THEN the system SHALL have updated memories available for the next turn
2. WHEN memory extraction runs THEN the system SHALL complete before the user can send their next message
3. WHEN the feedback cycle operates THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation flow without exposing technical details
4. WHEN multiple memory operations are needed THEN the system SHALL execute them all within the same conversation turn
5. WHEN the cycle fails at any point THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to normal chat functionality

### Requirement 6: Memory Quality Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot's memories to be accurate and relevant, so that the memory store enhances rather than degrades conversation quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting memories THEN the system SHALL only create memories based on explicitly stated information
2. WHEN determining memory categories THEN the system SHALL use clear classification rules for identity, principles, focus, and signals
3. WHEN creating key-value pairs THEN the system SHALL ensure keys are descriptive and values are concise
4. WHEN perspective normalization is needed THEN the system SHALL convert user statements to first-person bot perspective
5. WHEN memory quality is questionable THEN the system SHALL skip the memory operation rather than create poor quality entries
