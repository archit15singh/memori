# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating the existing React frontend with the FastAPI backend's `/chat` endpoint. The frontend currently uses mock responses but needs to be updated to make real HTTP requests to the backend API, handle loading states, errors, and provide a seamless chat experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend chat to communicate with the real backend API, so that I get actual responses instead of mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a message in the frontend THEN the system SHALL make a POST request to the backend `/chat` endpoint
2. WHEN the backend responds successfully THEN the system SHALL display the actual response from the API
3. WHEN I send multiple messages THEN the system SHALL maintain the conversation flow with real backend responses
4. WHEN the backend is available THEN the system SHALL use the real API instead of mock responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle API communication seamlessly, so that I can focus on the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server is running THEN the system SHALL communicate successfully with the API
2. WHEN the API request completes THEN the system SHALL display the response immediately
3. WHEN using the chat interface THEN the system SHALL provide a smooth user experience
4. WHEN the system encounters issues THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without complex error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive feedback during API calls, so that I know the system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a message THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator immediately
2. WHEN the API call is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the input field to prevent duplicate submissions
3. WHEN the response arrives THEN the system SHALL hide the loading indicator and show the response
4. WHEN the API call completes THEN the system SHALL re-enable the input field for the next message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable API endpoints, so that I can easily switch between development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use the correct backend URL for the current environment
2. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL connect to the local backend server (localhost:8000)
3. WHEN the backend URL changes THEN the system SHALL be easily configurable without code changes
4. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use the configured base URL consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to display backend responses correctly, so that the conversation flows naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend returns a successful response THEN the system SHALL extract and display the response text correctly
2. WHEN the backend returns a response THEN the system SHALL display it as a bot message
3. WHEN receiving API responses THEN the system SHALL maintain the conversation format
4. WHEN the response arrives THEN the system SHALL integrate it seamlessly into the chat flow
