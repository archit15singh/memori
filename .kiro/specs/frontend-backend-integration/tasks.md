# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create API service layer for backend communication
  - Create `frontend/src/services/chatApi.js` with ChatApiService class
  - Implement sendMessage method that makes POST requests to `/chat` endpoint
  - Add environment-based configuration for API base URL
  - Include basic response parsing for successful API calls
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Update frontend to use real API instead of mock responses
  - Replace mock MOCK_RESPONSES array and setTimeout logic in App.js
  - Modify sendMessage function to call the real API service
  - Import and initialize the ChatApiService in App.js
  - Maintain existing message flow and state management patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 3. Simplify sendMessage function for direct API communication
  - Remove any complex error handling from sendMessage function
  - Ensure direct API calls without try-catch complexity
  - Maintain clean and simple API integration
  - Focus on successful response handling only
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Enhance loading state management
  - Ensure loading indicator works correctly with real API calls
  - Disable input field during API requests to prevent duplicate submissions
  - Re-enable input field after API response or error
  - Maintain auto-focus behavior after API completion
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Add response format handling
  - Implement response parsing to extract message text from API response
  - Ensure proper display of backend responses as bot messages
  - Maintain consistent message formatting in chat interface
  - Integrate API responses seamlessly into conversation flow
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Verify integration with backend API
  - Manually verify successful API communication with running backend
  - Confirm CORS configuration works correctly between frontend and backend
  - Validate message sending and response display functionality
  - Check loading states and input field behavior during API calls
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.2_
