# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the LLM to automatically update its memory store using OpenAI tool calling. The bot will analyze conversations and use tools to create, update, or delete memories as needed, making its memory store grow and evolve naturally through conversations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory Management Tools

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to automatically manage its memories through conversations, so that its knowledge stays current and grows over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM identifies new memory insights THEN the system SHALL provide tools to create new memories
2. WHEN the LLM identifies memory updates THEN the system SHALL provide tools to update existing memories
3. WHEN the LLM identifies outdated memories THEN the system SHALL provide tools to delete memories
4. WHEN tools are called THEN the system SHALL execute the memory operations immediately
5. WHEN tool calls fail THEN the system SHALL log errors but continue normal chat operation

### Requirement 2: Tool Function Definitions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-defined tool functions for memory operations, so that the LLM can reliably manage memories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining tools THEN the system SHALL provide a `create_memory` tool with category, key, and value parameters
2. WHEN defining tools THEN the system SHALL provide an `update_memory` tool with category, key, and new value parameters  
3. WHEN defining tools THEN the system SHALL provide a `delete_memory` tool with category and key parameters
4. WHEN tools are defined THEN the system SHALL include clear descriptions and parameter validation
5. WHEN tools are called THEN the system SHALL validate parameters before executing operations

### Requirement 3: Automatic Memory Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to automatically detect when memory operations are needed, so that I don't have to manually manage its memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I share new personal information THEN the system SHALL automatically create appropriate memories
2. WHEN I provide updates to existing information THEN the system SHALL automatically update relevant memories
3. WHEN information becomes outdated THEN the system SHALL automatically remove or update memories
4. WHEN memory operations are performed THEN the system SHALL continue the conversation naturally
5. WHEN memory operations fail THEN the system SHALL not interrupt the conversation flow

### Requirement 4: Tool Integration with Chat

**User Story:** As a user, I want memory updates to happen seamlessly during conversations, so that the experience feels natural and uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM makes tool calls THEN the system SHALL execute them before generating the final response
2. WHEN memory operations complete THEN the system SHALL continue with the conversational response
3. WHEN multiple tool calls are needed THEN the system SHALL execute them all in the same turn
4. WHEN tool calls are made THEN the system SHALL not expose technical details to the user
5. WHEN memory is updated THEN the system SHALL use the updated memory in subsequent responses
