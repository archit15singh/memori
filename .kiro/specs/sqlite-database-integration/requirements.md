# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces the current in-memory storage with SQLite database persistence for the FastAPI backend. Focus is on core functionality: persisting memories and maintaining existing API compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want SQLite database integration, so that memory data persists between server restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a SQLite database with memory tables
2. WHEN the database doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically
3. WHEN the server restarts THEN the system SHALL retain all stored memories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my memories stored in a database, so that they persist across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I retrieve memories THEN the system SHALL fetch them from the SQLite database
2. WHEN I update a memory THEN the system SHALL modify the database record
3. WHEN I delete a memory THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing API endpoints to work unchanged, so that frontend integration continues working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL return the same response formats as before
2. WHEN the frontend makes requests THEN the system SHALL handle them identically to current implementation
